# 👋 Hi, I'm Harsh — aka QuantumHarsh

🚀 **Mechanical Engineering Student | Future Aerospace Innovator**  
🧩 Exploring **Quantum Physics, Mechanics & Space Systems**  
🎯 Aspiring **MIT Researcher** | Building my own **Space Agency** someday  
⚛️ Quantum Thinker  
🤖 Learning AI Automation Workflows (n8n)

---

I explore reality from two sides —  
the physics of how the universe behaves  
and the AI systems we build to automate it.

---

### ⚡ Current Focus
- MIT OCW **8.04 – Quantum Physics I**
- Building personal AI automations through **n8n**
- Creating research + communication workflow systems
- Exploring how information can move, transform & react like a quantum system
  
---

### 🧩 Core Interests
- Quantum Mechanics (MIT 8.04 Path)
- Mechanical & Aerospace Concepts
- AI Automation + Web Integrations
- System Design inspired by physics

---

### 🛰 Vision
Not to follow the world —  
but to design systems that **bend the rules** of how humans interact with information.

---

> “The universe runs on fundamental equations.  
> My goal is to build systems that run just as deep.”
